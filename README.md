**Decision Tree Classifier for Iris Dataset:**

This project aims to create a decision tree classifier for the Iris dataset and visualize it graphically. The Iris dataset is a popular machine learning dataset that consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, with 50 samples for each of three species. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The project uses Python programming language and the following libraries:

- Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning modeling
- Matplotlib and Graphviz for data visualization

The project consists of the following steps:

1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data cleaning and preparation
3. Data visualization
4. Model creation and evaluation
5. Prediction using the trained model

The decision tree classifier created in this project can be used to predict the class of new data points based on their features. For example, if we measure the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width of an iris flower and feed it to the classifier, it would be able to predict its species.

To run this project, clone the repository and install the required libraries. Then, run the Jupyter notebook to reproduce the results. The notebook contains detailed explanations of each step and code snippets for reference.

**Conclusion:**

This project demonstrates how a decision tree classifier can be created for the Iris dataset and visualized graphically. The classifier can be used to predict the class of new data points based on their features. The project also showcases how Python and its libraries can be used for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning modeling.
